This was a task from CSS bootcamp in which we analyzed how international trade leads to pollution. Data from the QOG suggests that as trade increases so do CO2 emissions overall. While CO2 emissions are a good marker of pollution, they are not a complete picture. It also seems that higher levels of trading lead to more climate laws. To fully understand this relationship it would be helpful to explore different measures of pollution.
